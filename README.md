 # How We divided the work in our Team member:-
 
 As we were five members in our team so it was very important to decide how we will approach the work so that
 
 in the future we should not face any problem in merging the code, as well as the tasks, get divided into equal 
 
 parts.So, on the first day, As a team leader, I made a git repository and everyone was told to make their separate 
 
 git branch by cloning the repo and push their work there and when they feel that they have completed it.They can show
 
 it to one of the members(team leader) and after the approval, they can merge their code to the main branch.I was mainly
 
 responsible for making the Flight selection page and navigation bar and script part which are similar on all the pages.
 
 And my other team members were responsible for the login page, landing page, and Cart page and make the page look better.
 
 # The outcome and important learning from the project:-
 
 This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and
 
 it gave us a lot of confidence. Although we could have done more such as we could have added a timer and there were some
 
 more functionalities that could have been done, yeah the time didn't permit us to go further. But we will surely improve it
